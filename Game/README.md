# The Game

The game itself relates to a shipping and distribution company that has to perform several pickups within the city and perform those in the minimum time possible.

We are the driver's assistant and our mission is to package the vehicle when he reaches the pick up point. This is done by arranging several packages in the truck, trying to maximise the space available, in order to reduce the time on the overall trip.

We also are given a choice on the order of the pick up points to execute.

The vehicle is driven automatically through AI and it will try to pick up the best route, navigating through the map and making automatic decisions to best overcome difficulties such as traffic, road blocks and slower speeds due to weather conditions.

The main point of the game is not to create a enjoyable playable overall, but rather to experiment on the AI navigational system (vehicle travel), the game interaction (package arrangement) and finally the several texture mapping and game engine development.
